# raspberry-pi-siem
Home-built SIEM and detection lab using Wazuh, OpenSearch, Docker, and a live SSH honeypot on Raspberry Pi 5.
Homegrown SIEM & Detection Lab (Raspberry Pi 5)
Overview

This project is a fully functional, home-built Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) lab deployed on a Raspberry Pi 5. The environment was designed to replicate real-world SOC workflows, including centralized log ingestion, alerting, threat detection, troubleshooting, and secure remote analyst access. The primary goal of the lab is to demonstrate practical blue-team skills using enterprise-style tooling while operating under realistic hardware and resource constraints.

The SIEM ingests logs from multiple sources, including a live SSH honeypot, and provides centralized visibility through a security dashboard. All components are containerized and secured using certificate-based authentication, with analyst access restricted through encrypted Zero Trust networking rather than exposed public services.

Purpose and Scope

The lab was built to deepen hands-on experience with SIEM deployment and security monitoring rather than simply installing tools. Emphasis was placed on understanding how logs flow through the system, how alerts are generated and validated, and how to diagnose and fix failures when components do not behave as expected. The environment reflects common challenges faced by SOC analysts, such as authentication failures, ingestion gaps, and resource limitations.

This project is intended for defensive security education and portfolio demonstration only and operates entirely within a controlled lab environment.

Architecture

The SIEM architecture consists of multiple data sources feeding into a centralized security stack. System and security logs, along with attack telemetry generated by an SSH honeypot, are forwarded to the Wazuh Manager. The manager processes and forwards events to the Wazuh Indexer, which is built on OpenSearch and responsible for storing and indexing the data. Analysts interact with the environment through the Wazuh Dashboard, which provides alerting, search, and visualization capabilities. Access to the dashboard is restricted through Tailscale, ensuring encrypted, authenticated connectivity without exposing services to the public internet.

Technology Stack

The lab runs on a Raspberry Pi 5 using a Debian-based Linux distribution. The SIEM stack consists of Wazuh Manager, Wazuh Indexer backed by OpenSearch, and the Wazuh Dashboard. Docker and Docker Compose are used to manage services and ensure repeatable deployments. A Cowrie SSH honeypot is deployed to generate real attack telemetry for detection and analysis. All internal communication between components is secured using TLS certificates, and remote analyst access is provided through Tailscale using a Zero Trust networking model.

Detection and Monitoring

The SIEM collects and normalizes logs from the operating system, security services, and the SSH honeypot. The honeypot simulates a vulnerable SSH service and records authentication attempts, credential harvesting activity, and post-authentication command execution. These events are ingested into the SIEM and surfaced through the dashboard, allowing analysis of attacker behavior and validation of detection logic.

Alerts are generated for suspicious activity such as repeated authentication failures, successful honeypot logins, and potentially malicious command execution. This provides visibility into common attack patterns while reinforcing alert triage and investigation skills.

Operational Challenges and Troubleshooting

Significant effort was spent resolving real operational issues rather than relying on default configurations. Certificate-based authentication problems between SIEM components were identified and corrected to restore secure communication. Indexer startup failures caused by memory constraints on ARM hardware were diagnosed and mitigated. Dashboard access issues and authentication errors were resolved through configuration review and testing. End-to-end log ingestion was repeatedly verified to ensure honeypot activity successfully flowed from source to dashboard without data loss.

These troubleshooting efforts mirror real SOC and security engineering workflows and form a core part of the project’s learning value.

Skills Demonstrated

This project demonstrates hands-on experience with SIEM deployment and administration, log ingestion and analysis, and threat detection using live attack data. It highlights practical Linux system troubleshooting, certificate-based security, Dockerized infrastructure management, and Zero Trust networking concepts. The lab reinforces a SOC analyst mindset focused on visibility, validation, and continuous monitoring rather than tool installation alone.

Future Improvements

Planned enhancements include developing custom detection rules, refining alert severity and noise reduction, onboarding additional endpoints, expanding visual dashboards to show attack trends over time, and integrating alert notifications. These improvements would further align the lab with enterprise SOC environments.

Disclaimer

This project was created strictly for educational and defensive security purposes within a controlled lab environment. No unauthorized access or malicious activity was conducted against external systems.
